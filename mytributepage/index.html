        channel, titled "BJP Exposed: Lies Behind The Bullshit", targeting
        Narendra Modi's government that had been elected earlier that year. In
        2016, Rathee earned online visibility after he "debunked" YouTuber Ajay
        Sehrawat's claims of Arvind Kejriwal's "ineffective" administration.
        Rathee said, "When I saw people sharing Ajay Sehrawat’s videos without
        checking the facts, I realised the need to present actual research in
        front of them so that they understand the truth."[13] Rathee released a
        series of fact-checking videos on his YouTube channel covering various
        topics including 2016 Uri attack, 2016 Indian Line of Control strike,
        2016 Indian banknote demonetisation and Gurmehar Kaur row. He launched
        Pee News, a satire "fake news" segment, in which he criticised BJP and
        Hindutva politics. He started a series called The Dhruv Rathee Show in
        which he continued to be critical of the central government.[13] Since
        2017, he has been writing opinion columns for ThePrint.[14] Currently,
        he lives in Germany.[citation needed] Reception In March 2020, Rathee
        mentioned on Twitter that Modi sold 170,000 hectares of "most dense
        forests in India" to Adani Group. He deleted the tweet after Adani Group
        threatened to file a defamation suit against him.[15] In one of his
        videos in June 2020, Rathee called the Black Lives Matter movement's
        name as "biased", claimed that it "favours blacks", and compared it to
        the feminist movement's name.[16][17] Controversies In November 2020,
        Actress Kangana Ranaut has responded to Dhruv Rathee’s viral video about
        her and she claims against him that he took significant amount of money
        to make it. In his video, Dhruv had complained about how Kangana is
        hypocritical in her statements and has a propensity of embellishing her
        comments. She also said " I can put YouTuber Dhruv Rathee behind bars
        for making a video on her and lying about BMC sending her a notice in
        2018
